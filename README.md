# pymysqlClass
Project: Python Database Management
This project is a simple implementation of a Python Database Management using the pymysql library. 
It offers a class named DbConnection, which allows the creation of tables, insertion, selection, updating, and deletion of data in a MySQL database.

Requirements
Before running this project, make sure you have the following requirements installed in your environment:

Docker: To use the MySQL database locally, you need to have Docker installed.
Docker is a container platform that allows you to run applications in isolated containers. It is widely used to create standardized development and testing environments.

MySQL Workbench (or another database manager): Although this project is focused on Python,
you will need a MySQL database manager to visualize and administer the database. We recommend MySQL Workbench,
but you can also use other MySQL-compatible managers.


Method Formatting
All methods in the DbConnection class are properly formatted to handle errors and exceptions related to database access.
If errors occur, they will be caught and displayed as informative messages.

Feel free to use this project as a starting point for your Python applications that require interaction with MySQL databases.
Remember to set up the environment variables correctly and install the requirements as indicated above.

Note: This project is a simplified demonstration and does not take into account security considerations such as proper handling of passwords and user authentication.
In a production environment, it is essential to adopt recommended security practices to protect your data.
